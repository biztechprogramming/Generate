# Oracle Database Class Code Generator

<!-- This repository contains a code generator for creating classes based on an Oracle database schema. -->
This repository contains a code generator for creating classes based on an Oracle database schema. The generator uses templates to generate the classes, making it easy to customize the generated code to meet your specific needs.

<!-- How to Use the Code Generator -->
## How to Use the Code Generator

The code generator is designed to be easy to use. Simply follow these steps to generate classes based on your Oracle database schema:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Update the configuration file (`config.json`) with your Oracle database connection information.
3. Run the code generator by executing the `generate.sh` script or the `generate.bat` script, depending on your operating system.
4. The generated classes will be written to the `output` directory.

<!-- Customizing the Generated Classes -->
## Customizing the Generated Classes

The generated classes are based on templates, which can be modified to meet your specific needs. The templates are located in the `templates` directory. If you need to make changes to the generated classes, simply modify the appropriate template and run the code generator again.
